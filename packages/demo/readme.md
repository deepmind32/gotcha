# FreeCaptcha - Name for now

There, will be 100 captchas 33 being easy, 33 being medium, and 34 being complex and almost impossible. A player starts with easier level captchas and on solving difficulty gets increased, if failed difficulty decreases or if there are no more easier it will be the same difficulty but not higher.

User can quit at any point but they will be prompted with some humorful message that taunts them.

On complete game, user will be able to save an achivement picture that will have following;
- Their name,
- Histogram in cartoonish manner should show what percentage of what was solved,
- A message regarding the user's progress.

# Ideas
## Easy
1. Typemaster
## Medium
### Hard (50% being impossible to solve)
1. Perfectly center the box, even not 1px tolerance
2. Remember the dots (3 levels)
3. Perfectly stack the block to 10 levels

Later, the idea is to create a npm package out of this.
